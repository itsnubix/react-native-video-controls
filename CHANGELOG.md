## 1.4.1 (30-08-2017)
Bug fixes. Updated `react-native-video` to ^2.0.0 in the peer deps and `react-native` to 47.2. Changed default title font size to 14.

[#42](https://github.com/itsnubix/react-native-video-controls/issues/42)
  - Related to a number of things...hitbox size, zIndex, overflow for whatever reason. Seekbar layout has been rebuilt and tested in both iOS and Android.

[#46](https://github.com/itsnubix/react-native-video-controls/issues/46)
  - Props were being assigned twice. Removing second assignment has resolved the issue.

## 1.4.0 (09-08-2017)
Distilled down some merge requests and found a simple solution to a seekbar issue reported. Sometimes you just gotta give your elements a little more space. Let this be a lesson not to rush out push requests between meetings...I think this warrants a larger version change...you can now pass any prop to the `<VideoPlayer>` element and it'll pass those to `react-native-video`. API changes quite a lot because of that but shouldn't break.

  - Added calculation to measure fill bar width and then subtract that from the width and assign to track bar on right side of icon.
  - Long story short, the icon now masks the volume bar.
